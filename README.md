# Task 01 Calculator

This Python program is a simple calculator that can perform addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and modulus operations. It prompts the user to select the desired operation, then asks for two numbers to perform the calculation. The result is then displayed to the user.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and modulus calculations.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user to select the operation and input numbers through the console.
- **Output Display**: Shows the result of the calculation to the user.
- **Option to Continue or Exit**: After each calculation, the user can choose to perform another operation or exit the calculator.

## Conditions Used

- **Input Function**: Accepts user input for selecting the operation and entering numbers.
- **Print Function**: Displays outputs, including the result of the calculation, to the user.
- **Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)**: Determines which operation to perform based on user input.
- **While Loop**: Continuously runs the calculator until the user decides to exit.
- **Break Statement**: Terminates the program when the user chooses to exit.
- **Continue Statement**: Allows the program to restart for performing another operation.
  
## How to Use

2. Select the desired operation (Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction, Division, or Modulus).
3. Enter the two numbers for the operation.
4. View the result of the calculation.
5. Choose to perform another operation or exit the calculator.

Enjoy using this simple calculator for your arithmetic needs!


# Task 03 Password Generator

This Python program generates random passwords containing symbols, numbers, and alphabets. It allows users to specify the length of the password, with a maximum of 30 characters.

## Features

- **Random Password Generation**: Generates secure passwords with a mix of symbols, numbers, and alphabets.
- **Customizable Length**: Users can specify the length of the password they want, up to a maximum of 30 characters.
- **Limited Length**: Ensures that the generated passwords do not exceed the specified length.

## Conditions Used

- **Input Function**: Accepts user input for the desired password length.
- **Print Function**: Displays the generated password to the user.
- **Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)**: Handles various conditions such as validating user input and controlling the flow of the program.
- **While Loop**: Allows the program to run continuously until the user decides to exit.
- **Break Statement**: Terminates the program when the user chooses to exit.
- **Continue Statement**: Allows the program to restart for generating another password.
- **Random Choice**: Utilizes the `random` module to select random characters for the password.
- **List**: Stores the available characters (symbols, numbers, alphabets) for password generation.
- **For Loop**: Iterates over elements in a list.
- **Lower Method**: Converts user input to lowercase to standardize comparison.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the desired length for the password.
3. The program generates a random password.
4. You can choose to generate another password or exit the program.

Ensure you remember or securely store the generated password!

Feel free to use this password generator to create secure passwords for your accounts.
